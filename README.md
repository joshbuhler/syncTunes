# syncTunes

syncTunes is a quick project I put together to easily copy files from my iTunes library onto a thumb drive for use with a Ford Sync 3 system.

Until I clean it up, everything below is just a mess of notes I was keeping while working on this.

# SYNC 3 Notes

> Info below is taken from the SYNC 3 Supplement manual, May 2015 printing.

The system is capable of hosting nearly any digital media player, including iPod, iPhone, and most USB drives.

Supported audio formats:
- MP3
- WMA
- WAV
- AAC
- FLAC

Supported audio file extensions:
- MP3
- WMA
- WAV
- M4A
- M4B

Supported USB file systems include: FAT, exFAT, and NTFS.

SYNC 3 is also able to organize the media from your USB device by metadata tags. Metadata tags, which are descriptive software identifiers embedded in the media files, provide information about the file.

If your indexed media files contain no information embedded in these metadata tags, SYNC 3 may classify the empty metadata tags as unknown.

SYNC 3 is capable of indexing up to 50,000 songs per USB device, for up to 10 devices.
