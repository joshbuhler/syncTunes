    // Most of the guts of SyncTunes will be moved here. This will handle the parsing of a playlist file, track creation, and a toString() method for writing the playlist file. syncTunes can handle the actual file writing.
    // SyncTunes will also be responsible for scanning a directory, and feeding the files to Playlist
